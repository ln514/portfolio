          <h1> About my life</h1>
          <p> I started drawing from the young age of seven. After attending years of private art class, I prepped proffesionaly with an artist to develop my skills so I could apply to middle schools that specialized in fine arts. After attending my middle school, I went on to continue prepping more advanced studies, learning about the human figure, still lifes, and landscapes. I took more exams and got into LaGuardia Highschool. While studying there, I spent my evenings taking classes at the Art Students League in the heart of New York City. I took a break from art while I was majoring in Humanities and Psychology during college, but after awhile I decided that art was my passion and switched majors right before I was suppose to graduate. I now work proffesionaly as an artist, creating pieces for new collections to be shared on social media. 
          </p>

          <p> Like everyone else, I continue learning and improving each day. We as humans are always works of progress and should strive for the best every day to get closer to our goals.</p>
